## 3. Usage

### Initialize the S3 service

You can initialize the service using either identity pool ID or access keys:

```dart

final s3service = FlutterAwsS3service();

// Initialize with identity pool ID
await s3service.initialize(region: 'YOUR_REGION', bucketName: 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME', identityPoolId: 'YOUR_IDENTITY_POOL_ID');

// Or initialize with access keys
await s3service.initialize(
region: 'YOUR_REGION',
bucketName: 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME',
accessKeyId: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
secretAccessKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
);
```

### Upload a file

```dart
// Upload a file and get the URL
final url = await s3service.uploadFile(filePath, // Local file path
key // S3 object key (path in bucket)
);
```

### List files in bucket

```dart
// Get list of files from S3 bucket
final files = await s3service.listFiles();
// Returns List<Map<String, dynamic>> containing file information
```

### Download a file

```dart
// Download a file from S3
await s3service.downloadFile(key, // S3 object key
localPath // Local path to save the file
);
```

### Delete files

```dart
// Delete a single file
await s3service.deleteFile(key);

// Delete multiple files
await s3service.deleteFiles(keys);
```
